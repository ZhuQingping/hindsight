/**
 * Host adapter runtime for PERSISTENT-PLUGIN harnesses (opencode, opencode2, Kilo, Cline, dsh, pi,
 * Prime Agent — every host that loads us once and keeps us). It delegates SessionStart and
 * prompt behavior to the same core lifecycle as fresh-process hook harnesses; this class keeps only
 * the host-specific injection, toast, and incremental-transcript responsibilities.
 *
 * A harness adapter feeds it three normalized events and reads two values back:
 *   - seedIfCold(repoPath)          : plugin load -> cold-check auto-seed (the page preamble is
 *                                     NOT computed here; onPrompt builds it per session)
 *   - onPrompt(sessionId, prompt)   : each user turn -> recall + build this turn's injection
 *   - getInjection(sessionId)       : the system-prompt text to inject this turn (or undefined)
 *   - toolSpecs()                   : the agentstratum_* knowledge/recall tools to register natively
 *   - onTranscript(sessionId, turns, lastTurnComplete): full transcript -> write back (on by default)
 *   - onSessionIdle(sessionId)      : assistant finished -> refetch + write back the completed
 *                                     exchange (the Stop-equivalent these hosts lack)
 *   - flush()                       : host is exiting -> wait (bounded) for in-flight write-backs
 * No opencode/claude specifics live here — only the memory logic.
