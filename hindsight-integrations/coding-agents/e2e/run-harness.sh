# Credentials arrive on a READ-ONLY mount and are copied into the location the CLI expects.

# Copying rather than bind-mounting onto the target is deliberate. Some harnesses authenticate from

# stores (copilot, cline) that the CLI opens read-write — a read-only mount there fails at startup.
# Copying also guarantees a test run can never modify the host's real subscription credentials.
